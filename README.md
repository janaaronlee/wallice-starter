# wallice-starter

A cookiecutter template project for [Wallice](https://github.com/janaaronlee/wallice]) for rapid prototyping and development.

## Requirements

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is the templating tool used for this project.

### Optional requirements

It is recommended to use a way to isolate your Python development environments. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) is needed if you want to use the provided `wow` utility script for development instead of [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

## Usage

### Cloning the starter project

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/janaaronlee/wallice-starter
```

### Using the `wow` utility

```bash
./wow
```
